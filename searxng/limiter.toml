# SearXNG Limiter Configuration
# Documentation: https://docs.searxng.org/admin/searx.limiter.html
# Purpose: Rate limiting for private instance (internal use only)
#
# Since this is a private instance (not public-facing), we disable
# most incoming bot detection but configure settings to prevent
# being detected as a bot by upstream search engines.

[botdetection]
# IP prefix for rate limiting (32 = per-IP, 24 = per /24 subnet)
ipv4_prefix = 32
ipv6_prefix = 48

[botdetection.ip_limit]
# Disable link-local filtering (we trust our local network)
filter_link_local = false
# Disable link token (not needed for API access)
link_token = false

[botdetection.ip_lists]
# Empty block list (internal use only)
block_ip = []
# Trust localhost and Docker network
pass_ip = [
    "127.0.0.1",
    "172.16.0.0/12",
    "192.168.0.0/16",
    "10.0.0.0/8"
